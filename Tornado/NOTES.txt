Folders Removed:
- state
- sentiment
- output (Question, seems important?)
- index.local.interfaces (also important?)
- helper.interval


Files Removed:
- test > everything except TestPOIsStaticDataSource.java
- spouts > everything except FileSpout.java, Queries*, Tweets*, TwitterFireHoseSpout.java
- local > NoLocalIndex.java
- helper > UInt32.java, MortonZCurve, CenterRightUpperCells.java, GoogleMapsProjection2.java, JsonHelper.java, KdTree.java, LineSegment.java, LHUCache.java, ObjectSizeCalculator.java
- experimental > OldExperiments.java, TornadoExperimentsSequence.java
- evaluator > Elavuator.java (Sounds important), Operator*, Query2.java, SpatialDistanceType.java, LogicalOperator.java. ArithmeticOperator.java, BooleanOperator.java, Geometry.java


Personal Notes:
- Without index.local.quadtree, there will be ArrayOutOfBounds error when emiting and building queries from QueriesFileSystemSpout
- Same with GlobalGridIndex.java in index.global. 
- Not sure what pom_2.xml is for
- What about results? 
- We will probably only be able to clear the comments and TODOs of the 4 main files this week if that's all right. 

Errors: 
- Sometimes, a while after the program is stopped:
